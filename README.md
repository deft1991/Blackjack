# **Blackjack**

Java application that plays the game of Blackjack (aka “21”).  
The computer is the dealer, and there can be from 1 to N players.

**Start**
1. Start the app
2. Enter players count
3. Type "hit" or "stand":
   - hit   -> get a card
   - stand -> go to the next player 
4. After game will be finished, type "again" or "exit":
   - again -> restart game
   - exit  -> exit from the app

**Future Improvements**
1. I can easily add multithreading
2. Add Spring Boot
3. Add CI/CD to AWS EC2
4. Add REST or gRPC API for browser/mobile-app
5. Check cheaters
